# Exercise: Create Webpage With All HTML Tags

## Objective


1. Open `index.html`
2. Using [this page](https://chelsea-dover.github.io/basic_site.html) and [this page](https://chelsea-dover.github.io/html_lists.html), create a webpage with an ordered list, unordered list, definition list, headers, paragraphs, images, links, tables, blockquotes and footers.


Once you're done with that you can create a new page and go through one of the list provided and use every HTML tag to it(by following the numbers below), and/or add tags to your index.html page for grouping([using this page as a guideline](https://chelsea-dover.github.io/more_tags.html)).

1. Create a new HTML file called `tags.html`
2. Go to either [this page](https://goo.gl/bwNFFH) or [this page](https://goo.gl/UVmY9Q).
3. Go through the list on the pages linked above and add every single HTML tag to your page. Don't worry about adding the deprecated tags.
