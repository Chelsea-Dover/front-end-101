# CSS Syntax

CSS works by following these steps:
1. Selecting an HTML element
2. Choosing a property to alter
3. Applying a value

Each pair of properies and values are called declarations.
Each declaration is separated by semicolons as shown below.
```
p {
    background: red;
    border: solid;
    width: 500px;
}
```
